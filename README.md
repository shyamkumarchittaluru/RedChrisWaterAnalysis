## **Business Question**

**How does mining activity at Red Chris Mine affect water potability and environmental conditions in the surrounding areas?**

We explored this question using:
1. **Water Potability Analysis**: Identifying factors affecting the quality of water.
2. **Environmental Impact Visualization**: Mapping weather and mining data geospatially.

---

## **Key Results**

1. **Water Potability**:
   - **Potability Prediction Models**: 
     - Logistic Regression achieved 68% accuracy.
     - XGBoost and Random Forest models also showed strong performance.
   - Key Indicators:
     - `Solids` showed the strongest correlation with water potability.
     - `pH` and `Chloramines` were weakly correlated.

2. **Environmental Impact**:
   - **ArcGIS Map**: Highlighted zones near Red Chris Mine prone to potential environmental stress.
   - **Weather Data Analysis**: Explored temperature, precipitation, and humidity trends to understand environmental risks.

3. **Power BI Dashboard**:
   - Interactive visuals provided stakeholders with actionable insights into water quality trends, precipitation patterns, and spatial impacts.

---

## **How We Solved It**

- **Data-Driven Approach**: 
   - Combined weather and water quality data to build predictive and analytical models.
   - Used machine learning to classify potable vs. non-potable water sources.

- **Visualization Tools**:
   - Power BI enabled easy navigation of insights through interactive slicers, maps, and charts.
   - ArcGIS provided spatial context to identify high-risk areas.

---

## **Crucial Insights**

1. **Potability Analysis**:
   - Only **39% of water sources** were classified as potable.
   - High `Solids` content was a critical factor in determining water quality.

2. **Environmental Impact**:
   - Cloud cover and precipitation trends could affect water sources.
   - Mining activity zones indicated potential risks to nearby ecosystems.

3. **Stakeholder Benefits**:
   - Dashboards offer real-time analysis for decision-makers.
   - Predictive models can guide future interventions to improve water safety.

---

## **Conclusion**

- The integration of geospatial analysis, machine learning, and visualization provides a comprehensive view of the Red Chris Mineâ€™s environmental impact.
- This project offers a scalable framework for analyzing similar mining sites globally.
